# Machine Learning Cheat Sheet
This cheat sheet provides a brief overview of the four main types of machine learning: Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Self-Supervised Learning, and Reinforcement Learning.

### Supervised Learning
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on labeled data. The algorithm learns to make predictions or decisions based on examples of input-output pairs. The goal is to minimize the difference between predicted output and actual output.

Examples: Image classification, Speech recognition, Text classification, Regression analysis

Common algorithms: Linear regression, Logistic regression, Decision trees, Random forests, Support vector machines (SVM), Neural networks (e.g., convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs))

### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on unlabeled data. The algorithm learns to find patterns or structure in the data without being given explicit guidance. The goal is to discover hidden relationships or groupings within the data.

Examples: Clustering, Anomaly detection, Dimensionality reduction, Association rule learning

Common algorithms: K-means clustering, Hierarchical clustering, Principal component analysis (PCA), Independent component analysis (ICA), Apriori algorithm

### Self-Supervised Learning
Self-supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from the data itself, without the need for explicit supervision. It uses a form of unsupervised learning, where the algorithm learns to make predictions about the data. The goal is to learn useful representations of the data that can be used for downstream tasks.

Examples: Image and video inpainting, Image and video colorization, Depth estimation, Temporal ordering of videos

Common algorithms: Contrastive predictive coding (CPC), Momentum contrast (MoCo), SimCLR, SwAV, BYOL

### Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns to make decisions based on feedback from its environment. The algorithm learns by trial and error, receiving rewards or punishments for each action it takes. The goal is to maximize the cumulative reward over time.

Examples: Game playing (e.g., AlphaGo), Robotics control, Autonomous driving, Recommendation systems

Common algorithms: Q-learning, Deep Q-networks (DQNs), Actor-critic models, Policy gradient methods, Proximal policy optimization (PPO)

Conclusion
This cheat sheet provides a brief overview of the four main types of machine learning. Each type of machine learning has its own strengths and weaknesses and is suited for different types of problems. Understanding the differences between these types of machine learning can help you choose the right approach for your problem.

I hope this cheat sheet is helpful for you!
